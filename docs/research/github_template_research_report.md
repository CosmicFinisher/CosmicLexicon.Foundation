# GitHub Template Research Report

## Project: OpenEchoSystem.Core Utilities and Extensions

### Date: 2025-06-14

### Research Goal:

To identify a suitable cookie-cutter project template on GitHub to accelerate the development of the OpenEchoSystem.Core Utilities and Extensions project. The ideal template should provide a good foundation for C# libraries, especially those that focus on code quality, testing, and documentation.

### Search Strategy:

The following search terms were planned for use on GitHub:

*   "C# library template"
*   "C# class library template"
*   "C# dotnet library template"
*   "C# xUnit template"
*   "C# library boilerplate"
*   "C# code analysis template"
*   "C# library with code analysis and testing"

### Research Process:

I attempted to use the `web-research` MCP server to search GitHub with the above search terms. However, I encountered a 429 error (rate limiting) and was unable to proceed with this method.

As an alternative, I used the `search_files` tool to search for potential template-related files within the existing repository. I searched for filenames containing "template" or "boilerplate" but found no relevant files.

### Findings:

Due to rate limiting, I was unable to conduct a comprehensive search for suitable templates on GitHub. The search of the existing project did not reveal any template-related files.

### Recommendation:

It is recommended to retry the GitHub search using the `web-research` tool at a later time, or to explore alternative methods for searching GitHub for suitable templates.
