# Potential Information Sources: ConsmicLexicon.Foundation Utilities and Extensions Research

To gather the necessary information for improving the `ConsmicLexicon.Foundation` library, the following information sources will be utilized:

1.  **`README.Core.md`:** This document provides the high-level overview, core principles, and structure of the `ConsmicLexicon.Foundation` library. It serves as the primary source for understanding the intended purpose and constraints of the library.
2.  **Module-Specific `README.Core.{FolderName}.md` files:** Each functional area within `src/` has its own README file (e.g., `src/collections/README.Core.Collections.md`). These documents provide detailed goals, purposes, descriptions, rules, and policies for their respective modules, offering crucial context for identifying missing features, understanding intended behavior, and evaluating adherence to principles.
3.  **Existing C# Source Files (`.cs`):** The C# files within the `src/` directory are the core subject of this research. Direct examination of the code is necessary to identify errors, assess code quality, evaluate commenting, and understand existing implementations.
4.  **Existing Test Files (`.cs` ending with "Tests.cs"):** The test files provide insight into the current test coverage and how the existing functionalities are intended to be used and verified. Analyzing these tests will help identify areas with insufficient coverage or where tests need improvement.
5.  **AI Search Tool (via MCP):** A general AI search tool will be used to gather external information, including:
    *   Best practices for writing C# utility and extension libraries.
    *   Common pitfalls and errors in C# core libraries.
    *   Guidance on effective code commenting and documentation.
    *   Strategies for comprehensive unit testing in C#.
    *   Examples of well-designed and well-tested foundational libraries in C#.
    *   Information on potential missing functionalities in .NET's `System.*` namespaces that could be relevant for `ConsmicLexicon.Foundation`.

The AI search tool will be particularly useful for exploring general C# development best practices and identifying potential areas for improvement based on common patterns and established standards. Queries will be formulated based on the key questions and emerging knowledge gaps.
